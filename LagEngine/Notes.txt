Short Term

add uniform value cache on cpu side to avoid sending the same values
allow meshes to create textures (or materials?). This makes me rethink the resource pre-declaration...

implement techniques, passes, textures...
define scenegraph through a xml file or scene "mesh"
Check and apply copy constructors good practices
Rethink folder structure and VS filters
coherency between tinyxml and ini parsers
check main loop and callbacks to the application. facilitate app development using the engine
fix lifecycles. resources should be selectively loaded and unloaded as needed. (per scene?)
shadow mapping
factory for generating renderApis and platforms specifics.
logs are not very user friendly

Long Term

Android/OpenGL ES
Multi-Threading
Research shader management techniques

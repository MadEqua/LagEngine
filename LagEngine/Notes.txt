Short Term

use cmake
replace enums by enum class
smart-pointers
free the in-memory images as soon as they are sent to the gpu (and meshes, shader code?)
key codes as enum
add uniform value cache on cpu side to avoid sending the same values
implement techniques and passes
define scenegraph through a xml file or scene "mesh"
shadow mapping
LogManager usage is not very user friendly
Render to textures Linear/sRGB correctness. https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Framebuffer

Long Term

Android/OpenGL ES
Multi-Threading
Research shader management techniques

Short Term

add uniform value cache on cpu side to avoid sending the same values
allow meshes to create textures (or materials?). This makes me rethink the resource pre-declaration...

implement techniques, passes, textures...
define scenegraph through a xml file or scene "mesh"
Check and apply copy constructors good practices
Rethink folder structure and VS filters
coherency between tinyxml and ini parsers
check main loop and callbacks to the application. facilitate app development using the engine


Long Term

Android/OpenGL ES
Multi-Threading
Research shader management techniques

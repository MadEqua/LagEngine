TODO

Short Term

a stage has a uniform description(metadata). a program has uniform instances with actual locations and values
think about uniforms and how to manage and automate them. add code for actual uniform creation.
allow meshes to create textures (or materials?). This makes me rethink the resource pre-declaration...

implement techniques, passes, textures...
define scenegraph through a xml file or scene "mesh"
Check and apply copy constructors good practices
Rethink folder structure and VS filters
coherency between tinyxml and ini parsers
check main loop and callbacks to the application. facilitate app development using the engine
rethink log manager. sometimes i want to change where to write to on a session basis


Long Term

Android/OpenGL ES
Multi-Threading
Research shader management techniques

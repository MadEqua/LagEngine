Short Term

check for memleaks changing scenes
cleaning resource managers should be automatic, and not needing a explicit call between scenes (and with a specific order)
dummy resources for all types
key codes as enum
add uniform value cache on cpu side to avoid sending the same values
implement techniques and passes
define scenegraph through a xml file or scene "mesh"
check main loop and callbacks to the application. facilitate app development using the engine
shadow mapping
factory for generating renderApis and platforms specifics.
LogManager usage is not very user friendly
smart-pointers
Render to textures Linear/sRGB correctness. https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Framebuffer

Long Term

Android/OpenGL ES
Multi-Threading
Research shader management techniques
